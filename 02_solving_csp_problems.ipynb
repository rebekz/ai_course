    "### Explanation of the Weighted Rule-based System\n",
    "\n",
    "The enhanced diagnostic system incorporates several important improvements:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Symptom Weights**: Each symptom has different weights for different diseases, reflecting that some symptoms are more indicative of certain conditions than others.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Symptom Severity**: The system considers the severity of each symptom on a scale of 1-10, which affects the final diagnosis. For example, a high fever contributes more to the diagnosis than a mild fever.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Confidence Scoring**: Instead of simply counting matching symptoms, the system calculates a confidence percentage based on the weighted scores relative to the maximum possible score for each disease.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Multiple Diagnoses**: The system returns multiple potential diagnoses ranked by confidence, which is more realistic in medical scenarios where differential diagnosis is common.\n",
    "\n",
    "This approach more accurately reflects real-world diagnostic processes, where healthcare professionals consider both the presence of symptoms and their severity, while also recognizing that some symptoms are more characteristic of certain conditions than others."

    "### Explanation of the PyHOP Example\n",
    "\n",
    "The above example demonstrates a Hierarchical Task Network (HTN) planning approach using a simplified implementation of PyHOP. Here's what's happening:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **State Representation**: The `State` class represents the world state, containing information about patients, their symptoms, available treatments, etc.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Planner Components**:\n",
    "   - **Operators**: These are primitive actions that can be directly executed (prescribe medication, order tests, refer to specialists)\n",
    "   - **Methods**: These are compound tasks that decompose into subtasks (treating different conditions)\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Planning Process**:\n",
    "   - The planner starts with a high-level task (`treat_patient`)\n",
    "   - It recursively decomposes tasks into subtasks based on the patient's symptoms\n",
    "   - It generates a sequence of primitive actions that form the treatment plan\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Domain Knowledge**:\n",
    "   - Medical knowledge is encoded in the methods and operators\n",
    "   - The system knows which medications are appropriate for which conditions\n",
    "   - It considers patient-specific factors like allergies and chronic conditions\n",
    "\n",
    "This approach differs from the rule-based expert system shown earlier. While both use rules, HTN planning focuses on generating a sequence of actions to achieve a goal, whereas the rule-based system focuses on classification or diagnosis based on symptoms."

    "1. **Constraint Satisfaction Problems (CSP)**:\n",
    "   - Useful for problems with clear constraints (e.g., graph coloring)\n",
    "   - Focuses on finding valid assignments to variables\n",
    "   - Well-suited for scheduling, configuration, and allocation problems\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Rule-based Expert Systems**:\n",
    "   - Based on if-then rules derived from expert knowledge\n",
    "   - Good for classification and diagnostic problems\n",
    "   - Transparent and explainable reasoning process\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Hierarchical Task Network (HTN) Planning**:\n",
    "   - Focuses on generating sequences of actions to achieve goals\n",

    "   - Well-suited for complex planning problems with hierarchical structure\n",
